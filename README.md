# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Introduction
This project is a browser-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented using JavaScript for game logic and DOM manipulation. The game dynamically updates the UI and handles player interaction in real-time.

## Live Demo
Check out the live demo here: [Hama's Tic Tac Bro](https://hamacodes.github.io/odin-tic-tac-toe/)

## Key Features
- **Modular Design:** The game logic is encapsulated using factory functions and modules, resulting in a clean, maintainable structure with minimal global variables.
- **Real-Time Gameplay:** The game provides instant feedback for player moves, updates the board dynamically, and handles win conditions and ties seamlessly.
- **Intuitive UI:** The user interface is designed for simple and intuitive interaction, allowing players to enjoy the game without distractions.
- **Replayablity:** The game can be played indefinitely as long as user opts to play again after each win or tie.

## What I Learned
- Managing state and game flow with JavaScript, ensuring smooth turn-taking and logic for determining game outcomes.
- Applying object-oriented principles through the use of factory functions and modules to encapsulate logic and maintain a clean codebase.
- Effectively manipulating the DOM and setting up event listeners to respond to user input.

## Challenges and Solutions
One of the key challenges was handling the logic for win conditions, especially ensuring that all rows, columns, and diagonals were checked after each move. I solved this by implementing a helper function that dynamically checks the board after each turn to identify a winner or a tie.

## Future Enhancements
- **AI Integration:** I plan to implement an AI player for single-player mode.
- **Animations:** Adding subtle animations for player moves and game outcomes to enhance the user experience.
- **Score Tracking:** Adding score tracking or even a leader-board to give the better tic tac toer bragging rights.
